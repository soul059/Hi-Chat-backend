# Public Chat Room Web Application

A public chat room web application is a platform that allows users to connect and communicate with each other in real-time. It typically provides a shared virtual space where users can send and receive text messages.

I've developed a public chat-based web application that allows you to converse with anyone present in the room.

## Key Features

1. **Room Management:** You have the ability to edit and delete the rooms you created.
2. **Message Management:** You can edit and delete messages you've sent by clicking on the message.
3. **Username Customization:** You can change your username by clicking on the profile icon located at the top right on the home page.

The app is hosted on the free version of Render, so please allow up to 50 seconds for the project to load after clicking the link.

Try it out with your friends!
